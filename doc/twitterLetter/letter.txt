Dear Sir or Madam

We are a group of six computer science students from Karlsruhe Institue of Technology (KIT), Germany. For a software project we would like to analyze the geographic spreading of information. Therefore we want to look at different accounts to see where on the world their tweets get retweeted.

Having run several small tests on your API we faced very small query limits, barely allowing us to collect enough data to get statistically significant results. We would like to ask you, whether it is possible to get higher query limits so that we would be able to collect some data about retweets and their geographic location.

Here are our account-informations:

and the homepage of our software project: http://dsn.tm.kit.edu/lehre_3581.php

We are looking forward to hearing from you.
Sincerely yours,
